# SYSC3010 Lab2 Deliverables

Lab2 is about setting up sqlite on the RPI and using the relational database along side python to build scripts to store data and visualize data from a sqlite database. This lab also covers receiving json responses from external sources and formatting the data to be suitible for sqlite databases. There are 3 python files in this project. The first file, lab2-database-data-logger.py, takes sensor data from the RPI Sense hat and stores it inside the sqlite database. The second file, lab2-database-data-visualizer.py, extracts data from a sqlite database, stores it in a pandas DataFrame, and plots the data on a plotly time series graph. The last python file, lab2-database-json.py, takes the data from an external API in the form of a json and stores it within a sqlite database.
