## Included Projects

### GPIO & Hardware Interfacing
- Control and read data from **LEDs** and **sensors**
- Learn how to use the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs **GPIO pins** safely
- Code examples using libraries like `RPi.GPIO` or `gpiozero`

### SQLite Database on the Pi
- Set up and interact with an **SQLite database** on your Raspberry Pi
- Store and query sensor readings or logs
- Lightweight and ideal for local data storage

### Cloud Connectivity
- Connect your Raspberry Pi to a cloud service (e.g., Firebase, AWS, or similar)
- Sync sensor data or logs for remote access and backup

### Web Server on Raspberry Pi
- Host a basic **web server** on the Pi (e.g., using Flask, Node.js, or similar)
- Build a simple dashboard to visualize sensor data or control LEDs remotely
