# SYSC3010 Lab3 Deliverables

Lab 3 is about setting up a firebase to support cloud database storage and faciliate read/writes from multiple RPIs without direct connection or latency that could occur when storing locally. Lab 3 was also about using the Flask library to set up basic web servers and web applications that serve HTML files while providing a python backend service. In lab3-firebase.py, we set up the read/writes to the firebase real-time database. For the myflaskwebserver.py, a template HTML page was served, where the name that was displayed reflected a variable we initalize in the flask app route. The webserver.py served an interactive HTML/JS page that displayed an interactive LED grid. It was configured so that whenever a grid was colored on the web page, that same pixel on the sensehat was also lit up, with the same RGB as the file.
