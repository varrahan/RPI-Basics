# SYSC3010 Lab1 Deliverables

Lab1 is about the basics of setting up and using the RPI and RPI SenseHat. It provides basic implementation on how we can use the RPI SenseHat's LED's and sensors. Lab1 contains 3 files. One file is a screenshot of the output when calling ifconfig from an ssh terminal. Another file, showmyname.py that outputs my username on a loop. The final file, showsensordata.py, displays te temperature, humidity, and pressure that is read from the RPI onto the SenseHat LED as a scrolling message.
